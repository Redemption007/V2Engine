# Hi !
You just have downloaded the project V2Engine.
There's a lot to experience, and we hope you'll enjoy it !

Now the project is downloaded, you juste have to do a few changes to make it functionnal.
- You have to rename the 'parametres.model' file in 'parametres.js'. The file is here : './Bot/starterpack/parametres.model'
- In the same file, mind to change the informations with yours.

If there's any issue, please open a new issue here : https://github.com/Redemption007/V2Engine/issues/new
Thank you for your participation.
